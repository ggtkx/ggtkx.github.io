      <p>Q1: Is there an age restriction for the audience at the ZGZG Gala?</p>
      <p>Ans: There is no age restriction for the audience at the Gala. The event follows a one ticket per seat system, and all children (including those under three) must have a ticket for entry. Audience members with specific needs can purchase designated seats through Eventbrite.</p>

      <p>Q2: What are the ticket prices for this year?</p>
      <p>Ans: The event offers tiered ticket prices: $28, $38, $48, and $68. When purchasing tickets, you can choose your preferred seat on the seating chart.</p>

      <p>Q3: Are there any additional fees for the tickets?</p>
      <p>Ans: We sell tickets through the Eventbrite platform, which charges approximately 3% in processing fees. Unfortunately, these fees are non-refundable in case of ticket returns.</p>

      <p>Q4: Is there an early bird discount this year? How can I use it?</p>
      <p>Ans: Please stay tuned for the latest updates on ZGZG's official account for information on any early bird discounts.</p>

      <p>Q5: What is the refund policy?</p>
      <p>Ans: You can request a refund without conditions until January 15, 2024. Click "refund" on the purchase confirmation page. Note that Eventbrite processing fees are non-refundable. After this date, no refunds will be accepted.</p>

      <p>Q6: Do I need to print my tickets?</p>
      <p>Ans: No, electronic tickets are sufficient. For environmental reasons, we recommend storing the ticket QR code on your phone for easy entry and ticket verification.</p>

      <p>Q7: Can I transfer my tickets to someone else?</p>
      <p>Ans: You can transfer tickets through your Eventbrite account. However, please note that the event organizers are not responsible for any independently arranged ticket transfers.</p>

      <p>Q8: How do I use a promo code?</p>
      <p>Ans:
          <ol>
              <li style="color: #949494">Click the "Enter promotional code" link.</li>
              <li style="color: #949494">Enter the promo code in the text box.</li>

          </ol>
          
      </p>

If you forgot to use the promo code during registration, email contact-us@zgzg.io, and we will do our best to assist you.

      <p>Ans: No. According to the policy of the theater, food, drinks, alcohol, and pets are not allowed.</p>
